          <h2>Challenge Statement:</h2>
          <p>Choose a theme or everyday object to create 8 designed pages using
            your theme or object as conceptual basis. These may work together as
             a narrative or be 8 individual, self-contained pages.The designed
             pages will be combined into either a hinged book, an accordion book,
              or placed within a portfolio specifically made for them.
          </p>

          <h2>Solution Statement</h2>
          <p>For this assignment I created a travel book showcasing different
            cities in different countries around the world. This was successful
            as each country was illustrated through one of the design techniques
             taught in class - black and white cut out shapes,
             cut outs using colored shapes, painting, having an interactive overlay,
              and a pop-up.</p>

          <h2>Materials used:</h2>
            <p>bristol paper, cutting knife, scissors, bone folder, cardboard,
              color aide paper, black paper, glue, string, and a needle.</p>
