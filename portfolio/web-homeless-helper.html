          <h1>Help the Homies</h1>
          <h2>Challenge Statement:</h2>
          <p>At Cal Hacks 5.0, my team and I were faced with the challenge of
            building something that could change the world using technology.</p>

            <h2>Solution Statement:</h2>
          <p>As a solution to the problem of homelessness, Help the Homies is a
            web application that allows people to request and fulfill the needs
             of homeless people.</p>

          <p>Being a site designed to help others, my team and I made the
            application as user friendly as possible in hopes for higher rates
            of users using the application. To do so, the application uses
            Bootstrap CSS to add a very modern style. As part of the team, I
            worked on the back-end JavaScript to figure out how to use the Google
             Maps API and Firebase to store the location data and drew the initial
             markup designs for the front-end.</p>

           <p>Additionally, to add a more advanced connected feel to the application,
              the map is interactive, with updating pin drop animations when the
              submit button is clicked and movable so audiences can see more than
              their local areas, but everywhere around the world.</p>
