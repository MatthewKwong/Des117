          <h1>Design 1 Process Book</h1>
          <h2>Challenge Statement:</h2>
          <p>Implement the design process and document your work while you join
            forces with fellow students to build an analog (physical, not digital)
            design suitable for inclusion in Emily Pilloton’s book Design Revolution.
            You will present a fully workable final prototype that demonstrates
            how your design will function.
          </p>

          <h2>Solution Statement</h2>
          <p>For this assignment I was put into a group with 3 other classmates
            where we were presented with designing an object for the category of
             “Play”. We were then to individually make our own process books
             presenting the design process behind what we made. What made my book
              successful was that I used a consistent playful color scheme and
              graphics that kept the theme of the book, but still professionally
              exhibited the process behind our product.</p>
