          <h2>Semantic HTML - Elements used and how they describe the structure's content:</h2>
          <p>I chose to nest section for each individual subtopic under an article
            tag so that it's easier to go through the code later on and recognize where each
            subtopic begins. My format goes as followed: article, div, header, nav,
            section, footer. I chose this layout because I believe it was the most
            it's the most clear and concise way of displaying information and
            easiest way to navigate through the page to the reader.</p>

          <h2>What are you experimenting with and trying to achieve:</h2>
          <p>In my article, I was trying to achieve the look of a mix between
          a New York Times article and a blog. To do this I used similar fonts to
          the news corporation especially when it came to using blockquotes to
          quote something. Additionaly, I added a navbar at the top of the page to
          help navigate through the page and added a hover effect on it to clearly
          show the user what section they would view if they clicked the tab they
          hovered on. In terms of visual images, I created a vector art bus in
          Adobe Illustrator to keep it consistent with the fonts I used throughout
          the article. If I were to redo this project I would want to make it more
          modern and not have everything in a one vertical column, but rather
          section off each subheading to its own space.</p>

          <h2>Most challenging part of visual design:</h2>
          <p>While working on this project, I think the hardest part for me in terms of
          visual design was choosing the best font possible and making sure that
          my headings and paragraphs were clearly distinguishable from one another
          through typography and font weights.</p>
