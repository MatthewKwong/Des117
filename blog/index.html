          The Core Model: Designing Inside Out for Better Results</a></i>
          she writes about using a "core model" system to design webpages.
          The model consists of two key factors, a business objective
          and fulfilling user tasks.</p>

          Desktop vs. mobile app design: how to optimize your user experience</a></i>

           designing a web page because it is easier to add content.</p>

          <p class = "time"><time datetime="2019-05-01">May 2, 2019</time></p>
          <p>Roboto was designed by Christian Robertson in 2011. This font is
            most famously known for being the system font for Android 4.0
            "Ice Cream Sandwhich". It was later redesigned in 2015 for Android
             5.0 "Lollipop".</p>

          <p class = "time"><time datetime="2019-05-01">May 1, 2019</time></p>
          <p>I chose to nest section for each individual subtopic under an
            article tag so that it's easier to go through the code later on
            and recognize where each subtopic begins. My format goes as
            followed: article, div, header, nav, section, footer.</p>

          <p>In the future, I believe that the way we consume our digital
            media in the world will drastically change.
            In the way we look and consume digital media, cable networks will
            disappear with time and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu
            will take over.</p>
