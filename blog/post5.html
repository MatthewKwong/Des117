          <h2>What is a core model?</h2>
          <p>In Ida Aalen's article,<i><a href = "https://alistapart.com/article/the-core-model-designing-inside-out-for-better-results/">
            The Core Model: Designing Inside Out for Better Results</a></i>
            she writes about using a "core model" system to design webpages.
            The model consists of two key factors, a business objective and
            fulfilling user tasks. To successfully use this model, you not
            only fulfill the information reader's hope to find on a site,
            but convert users to fulfill an objective path of your own.</p>

          <p>The main idea of this article was to attract web-developers and
            convert them to using this storybuilding technique as she says that
            by using this model it can lead to higher success rates of your own
            business objectives.</p>

          <p>Aalen also talks about the main difference between a core model
            and wireframe as with wireframing you're only focussing on the design
            rather than the actual experience going through and the
            content being displayed to readers.</p>

          <p>Finally, Aalen goes to talk about the success rates of using a
            core model as she uses a lung cancer association as her example,
            breaking down the flow of their site and how it leads to the end goal
            of having audiences donate to the association once reading information
            about the cnacer. She says that by using this format, you will
            see HUGE success rates as long as you follow this core model and that
            by focussing on mobile pages there are often higher conversion rates.</p>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <p>From this article I learned a lot about branding and best ways to
            engage viewers to my content. Wanting to go into either front-end
            web development or UI/UX, this was a really important article to
            read as it goes through the idea of how based on the
            <b>business objective</b> you should emphasize the
            graphics on the page towards that objective.</p>

          <p>However, what audiences may not realise is that she herself is using
            the core model in this article as she is telling readers to
            follow this model for better success rates in their own businesses</p>
