        <p> In the future, I believe that the way we consume our digital media in the world will drastically change.  In the way we look and consume digital media, cable networks will disappear with time and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu will take over.  From a social media aspect, I believe that social media will continue to expand and create even larger significance in our lives, controlling our interactions with one another, the way we pay, and politics. With this in mind, I think that higher safety measures and precautions regarding our security will have to be implemented because of current issues we have in today’s society. For example, when looking at technology like Open AI’s DeepFake facial recognition technology could drastically change our perception of what we’re seeing, making us falsely believe what Presidential candidates believe. If this were to be used on social media, it could be a huge danger to governments.</p>
        <p>With all this tech advancement and progression, comes its effects society. Already today we see how much internet privacy means and I believe that it will only become more important and stronger. However, if social media companies begin to control the way we pay businesses, these companies would have control of what we’re purchasing, knowing more about who we are and using this data for advertisements. With facial recognition technology, I think that there will be more counter groups trying to stop it from happening or can help us determine what is fake or not. However, if it continues, it will cause a major disruption on political governments and people’s lives. After doing this research, it makes me worried about the direction technology is headed and makes me ask myself if much of the stuff I see today is real. I think it’s interesting how much technology and media can control what we perceive and believe, but there comes a lot of risks and dangers with it.</p>
